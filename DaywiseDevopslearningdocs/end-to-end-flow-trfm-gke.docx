That choice shows professional maturity. This is exactly how real DevOps engineers work:

Deploy → Verify → Learn → CLEAN UP → Document

We’ll do this in two clean phases:
1️⃣ Destroy infrastructure safely (NO COST)
2️⃣ Document everything end-to-end (interview-ready)

🧹 PHASE 1: CLEANUP (Terraform Destroy)
🔑 WHY cleanup is mandatory (Interview-level)

Cloud resources cost money while running.
DevOps engineers must destroy non-prod infra immediately after use.

You already verified:

App is running

Deployment works

Pipeline works

So now we destroy.

✅ Step 1: Go to terraform directory
cd ~/school-management-app/terraform

✅ Step 2: Destroy infra
terraform destroy -var="project_id=velvety-maker-480912-u3"


When prompted:

Do you really want to destroy all resources?


Type:

yes


⏳ This will take 5–10 minutes.

✅ Step 3: Verify cleanup

After completion, you should see:

Destroy complete! Resources: X destroyed.


Optional verification:

kubectl get nodes


Expected:

Unable to connect to the server


✅ Cluster is gone.

🧠 Interview GOLD line

“After validation, we destroy non-production infrastructure using Terraform to avoid unnecessary cloud costs.”

🚦CONFIRMATION REQUIRED (ONE LINE)

After destroy finishes, reply:
👉 “Terraform destroy completed and GKE resources removed”

Then we move to Phase 2: DOCUMENTATION.

📘 PHASE 2: DOCUMENT EVERYTHING (THIS IS IMPORTANT)

I will now give you a final structured documentation outline that you can:

Keep as personal notes

Revise before interviews

Use to explain your project clearly

⚠️ As you requested earlier:

❌ No long theory

✅ Only Flow, Commands, Common Errors, Interview Explanation

📌 DOCUMENT 1: END-TO-END DEVOPS FLOW (MASTER)
Flow
GitHub
 → Jenkins (CI)
 → Docker build
 → Artifact Registry
 → Terraform (GKE)
 → Kubernetes Deployment
 → Service (LoadBalancer)
 → Browser
 → Cleanup

Interview Explanation

Built a complete CI/CD pipeline deploying a containerized application to GKE using Jenkins, Docker, Terraform, and Kubernetes.

📌 DOCUMENT 2: GIT & GITHUB
Flow
Local code → Commit → Push → Jenkins trigger

Commands
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
git rm --cached .terraform
git filter-repo --force
git push --force

Common Errors

Large file >100MB → terraform provider committed

Push rejected → history rewrite required

Interview Explanation

Git is used as source of truth. Terraform cache and state files are excluded from version control.

📌 DOCUMENT 3: JENKINS (CI)
Flow
GitHub → Jenkinsfile → Pytest → Docker build → Docker push

Commands
docker build
docker tag
docker push

Common Errors

Unauthenticated push → Jenkins user not logged into GCP

Docker permission denied → Jenkins not in docker group

Interview Explanation

Jenkins automates build, test, and image publishing stages.

📌 DOCUMENT 4: DOCKER & ARTIFACT REGISTRY
Flow
Docker image → Tag → Push → Artifact Registry

Commands
docker build -t app .
docker tag app us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT/repo/app:tag
docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT/repo/app:tag

Common Errors

Unauthenticated request → Docker not configured with GCP

Wrong repo name → push fails

Interview Explanation

Artifact Registry is used to store container images for Kubernetes.

📌 DOCUMENT 5: TERRAFORM (IaC)
Flow
Terraform init → plan → apply → destroy

Commands
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy

Common Errors

ADC missing → Terraform auth fails

API disabled → 403 error

Billing disabled → resource creation fails

Interview Explanation

Terraform provisions and destroys cloud infrastructure in a repeatable manner.

📌 DOCUMENT 6: KUBERNETES (GKE)
Flow
Deployment → Pod → Service → External IP

Commands
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
kubectl describe pod

Common Errors

ImagePullBackOff → wrong image tag

Service not found → Service not created

EXTERNAL-IP pending → wait

Interview Explanation

Kubernetes manages containerized workloads and exposes them via services.

📌 DOCUMENT 7: PYTEST & CI QUALITY
Flow
Code change → Pytest → Build allowed/blocked

Commands
python3 -m pytest -v

Common Errors

Tests not updated after app change

JSON vs HTML mismatch

Interview Explanation

Pytest ensures only validated code is built and deployed.

🏆 FINAL INTERVIEW SUMMARY (USE THIS)

“I implemented an end-to-end DevOps pipeline using GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, Artifact Registry, Terraform, and GKE. I handled authentication, permissions, API enablement, CI failures, Kubernetes rollout issues, and cost-safe cleanup. The pipeline supports repeatable deployments and safe teardown.”
