🔹 STEP 1: Open Terminal & Go to Project Directory
cd ~
ls


Find your project folder:

cd school-management-app

🔑 MUST KNOW

Git works per directory.
You must be inside the repo folder.

🔹 STEP 2: Verify It Is a Git Repository
git status

Expected output:
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.


or

Changes not staged for commit:

🔑 MUST KNOW

If this works → .git folder exists → repo is intact

Git state is preserved even after reboot

🔹 STEP 3: Check Which Branch You Are On
git branch


Expected:

* main

🔑 MUST KNOW

Always confirm branch before committing

Prevents accidental commits to wrong branch

🔹 STEP 4: Check Remote Connection (VERY IMPORTANT)
git remote -v


Expected:

origin  https://github.com/<your-username>/school-management-app.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<your-username>/school-management-app.git (push)

🔑 MUST KNOW

Confirms where your code will be pushed

If missing → pushes will fail

🔹 STEP 5: Check What Has Changed
git status


You should see:

Modified files (Dockerfile, app files, etc.)

Or “nothing to commit”

🔑 MUST KNOW

This is the most-used Git command in real life.

🔹 STEP 6: Stage Changes

If everything is correct:

git add .

🔑 MUST KNOW

Stages all modified files

Use cautiously in large repos

🔹 STEP 7: Commit Changes
git commit -m "Add Dockerfile and Dockerized Flask app"

🔑 MUST KNOW

Commit message explains what changed

Use present tense

🔹 STEP 8: Push to Same Branch (main)
git push


Because you already ran:

git push -u origin main


earlier, you don’t need -u again.

🔐 STEP 9: Authentication (If Prompted)

If GitHub asks for login:

Use GitHub Personal Access Token

NOT password

🔑 MUST KNOW

GitHub no longer supports password auth.

🔹 STEP 10: Verify on GitHub UI

Open GitHub repo

Refresh page

Confirm:

Dockerfile exists

Code updated

Commit message visible

🧠 Interview-Ready Explanation

Q: What happens to Git state after system reboot?

Your Answer:

“Git metadata is stored inside the project directory in the .git folder, so restarting the system doesn’t affect repository state. We just navigate back to the repo and continue work.”
