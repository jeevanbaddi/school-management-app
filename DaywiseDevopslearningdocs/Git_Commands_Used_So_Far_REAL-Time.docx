Git Commands Used So Far (REAL-TIME, NO EXTRA)

Below are only the commands actually used in Step-1, with why they are used in real projects.

1️⃣ git init
git init

What it does

Converts a normal folder into a Git repository

Creates the hidden .git/ directory

Real-time usage

Used once per project

Always the first Git command in a new local project

2️⃣ git status
git status

What it does

Shows:

Untracked files

Staged files

Branch name

Real-time usage

Used before every commit

Helps avoid committing wrong files

3️⃣ git add .
git add .

What it does

Stages all new and modified files

Real-time usage

Used when committing multiple files

Faster than adding files one by one

⚠️ In real projects, sometimes:

git add app/main.py


(to stage specific files)

4️⃣ git commit -m
git commit -m "Initial project structure for school management app"

What it does

Saves a snapshot of staged files

Creates a commit with a message

Real-time usage

Every logical change = one commit

Commit message explains what & why

5️⃣ git branch -M main
git branch -M main

What it does

Renames current branch to main

Real-time usage

Standardizes branch name

Required because GitHub default branch is main

6️⃣ git remote add origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/school-management-app.git

What it does

Connects local repo to remote GitHub repo

Real-time usage

Used once per repository

Without this, git push will fail

7️⃣ git push -u origin main
git push -u origin main

What it does

Pushes local commits to GitHub

-u sets upstream tracking

Real-time usage

First push always uses -u

After this, simple git push is enough

🧠 Interview-Ready Summary (Very Important)

Q: How do you start a new project with Git?

Your Answer:

“I initialize the repository using git init, check file status, stage files using git add, commit with meaningful messages, set the main branch, link the remote GitHub repository, and push the initial structure.”

🔥 This is a perfect professional answer.

📌 Commands You Did NOT Use (Correctly)
Command	Why not used now
git clone	Repo already created locally
git pull	No remote changes yet
git checkout -b	Single main branch for now
git merge	No branches yet
