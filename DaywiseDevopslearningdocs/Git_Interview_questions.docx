🔥 ADVANCED & MOST-ASKED GIT + GITHUB INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

(4–6 Years DevOps Engineer)

I’ve grouped them so they’re easy to remember.

🧠 SECTION-1: CORE GIT CONCEPTS (DEEP UNDERSTANDING)
1️⃣ What happens internally when you run git commit?

Answer (Strong):
When git commit is executed:

Git takes staged changes from the index

Creates a snapshot (tree object)

Generates a commit object containing:

Author

Timestamp

Commit message

Parent commit hash

Updates HEAD to point to the new commit

📌 Why interviewers ask:
To check if you understand Git internals.

2️⃣ What is the difference between working tree, staging area, and repository?

Answer:

Working tree → Files you edit

Staging area → Files marked for commit (git add)

Repository → Committed history

Real-time:
You selectively stage only required files before commit.

3️⃣ How does Git detect file changes?

Answer:
Git uses content hashing (SHA-1/SHA-256), not timestamps.
If content changes → hash changes → Git detects modification.

4️⃣ What is HEAD in Git?

Answer:
HEAD is a pointer to the current commit or branch you are working on.

Detached HEAD occurs when you checkout a commit instead of a branch.

🌿 SECTION-2: BRANCHING & MERGING (CRITICAL)
5️⃣ Difference between git merge, git rebase, and git cherry-pick?
Command	Purpose	Use case
merge	Combine branches	Team work
rebase	Reapply commits	Clean history
cherry-pick	Pick specific commit	Hotfix

Interview Tip:

“We avoid rebasing shared branches.”

6️⃣ When would you prefer rebase over merge?

Answer:

Local feature branches

Before creating PR

To keep linear history

Never on shared branches.

7️⃣ What causes merge conflicts and how do you prevent them?

Answer:
Conflicts occur when same file + same line is modified differently.

Prevention:

Pull latest main

Small commits

Short-lived branches

8️⃣ What is a fast-forward merge?

Answer:
When main has no new commits, Git just moves the pointer forward.

git merge feature-branch


No merge commit created.

🧨 SECTION-3: RESET, REVERT & RECOVERY (PRODUCTION SAFETY)
9️⃣ Difference between git reset --soft, --mixed, --hard?
Mode	Effect
soft	Keeps changes staged
mixed	Keeps changes unstaged
hard	Deletes everything

📌 Rule:
Never use --hard on shared branches.

🔟 When should you use git revert?

Answer:
To rollback production code safely without rewriting history.

Creates a new commit.

1️⃣1️⃣ How do you recover a deleted commit?

Answer:
Using reflog:

git reflog
git checkout <commit-id>

🔁 SECTION-4: COLLABORATION & GITHUB (REAL ENTERPRISE)
1️⃣2️⃣ What are branch protection rules?

Answer:
Rules that restrict direct pushes and enforce:

PRs

Reviews

CI checks

1️⃣3️⃣ How do you enforce CI before merge?

Answer:
Using branch protection → “Require status checks to pass”.

1️⃣4️⃣ How does GitHub webhook work?

Answer:
GitHub sends HTTP POST events to Jenkins on push/PR → pipeline triggers.

1️⃣5️⃣ Difference between GitHub Actions and Jenkins?
Jenkins	GitHub Actions
External	Native
Complex	Simple
Highly customizable	GitHub-centric
🏷️ SECTION-5: RELEASES, TAGS & DEPLOYMENTS
1️⃣6️⃣ What are Git tags and how are they used?

Answer:
Tags mark release points.

git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0


Used for rollback and deployments.

1️⃣7️⃣ How do you rollback to a previous release?

Answer:

Redeploy old tag

Or revert commits after release

1️⃣8️⃣ Difference between lightweight and annotated tags?

Answer:
Annotated tags store metadata (author, message).
Preferred for production releases.

🔐 SECTION-6: SECURITY & BEST PRACTICES
1️⃣9️⃣ How do you prevent secrets from being committed?

Answer:

.gitignore

Pre-commit hooks

Secret scanners

2️⃣0️⃣ What if a secret is already committed?

Answer:

Rotate secret

Remove from history (BFG / filter-repo)

⚙️ SECTION-7: REAL DEVOPS SCENARIOS
2️⃣1️⃣ How does Git trigger Kubernetes deployment?

Answer:
Merge → CI → Build image → Push registry → Deploy to cluster

2️⃣2️⃣ How do you handle hotfixes in production?

Answer:

Create hotfix branch from main

Fix issue

Merge back to main

2️⃣3️⃣ How do you ensure clean commit history?

Answer:

Squash commits

Rebase before PR

Enforce PR rules

2️⃣4️⃣ What is detached HEAD and how do you fix it?

Answer:
Occurs when checkout a commit.
Fix by switching to a branch.

2️⃣5️⃣ How do you sync forked repositories?

Answer:

git remote add upstream <repo>
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main

🧠 FINAL INTERVIEW GOLDEN ANSWER (Memorize This)

“We follow a PR-based Git workflow with protected main branch, automated CI via webhooks, and safe rollback using tags and revert. We avoid history rewriting on shared branches and ensure only validated code reaches production.”
