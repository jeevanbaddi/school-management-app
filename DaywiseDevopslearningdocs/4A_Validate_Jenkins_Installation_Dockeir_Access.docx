STEP-4A: Validate Jenkins Installation & Docker Access
🔑 MUST KNOW (4+ Years DevOps Engineer)

Before creating pipelines, you always validate:

Jenkins service is running

Jenkins user exists

Jenkins can access Docker

Jenkins can run shell commands

1️⃣ Check Jenkins Service Status (VERY FIRST CHECK)

Run:

sudo systemctl status jenkins

Expected (GOOD):
● jenkins.service - Jenkins Continuous Integration Server
   Active: active (running)

If NOT running:
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins


🔑 MUST KNOW

Jenkins runs as a systemd service

Should always start automatically after reboot

2️⃣ Verify Jenkins Is Accessible (UI Check)

Open browser:

http://localhost:8080


✔ Login page loads → Jenkins installed correctly

3️⃣ Check Jenkins User (CRITICAL)

Run:

id jenkins


Expected:

uid=xxx(jenkins) gid=xxx(jenkins) groups=xxx(jenkins)


🔑 MUST KNOW

Jenkins runs as user jenkins

Any permission issue is related to this user

4️⃣ Check Docker Installation (System Level)

Run:

docker --version


Expected:

Docker version xx.xx.xx


If Docker not found → Jenkins cannot use Docker.

5️⃣ Check Docker Service Status
sudo systemctl status docker


Expected:

Active: active (running)


If not:

sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

6️⃣ MOST IMPORTANT: Check Jenkins → Docker Access

Run:

sudo -u jenkins docker ps

✅ If SUCCESS:
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE   COMMAND   STATUS


🎉 Jenkins already has Docker access
👉 You can proceed to pipeline

❌ If ERROR (Most Common):
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket


👉 This means Jenkins does NOT have Docker access
We must fix it.

🔧 FIX: Give Jenkins Docker Access (STANDARD SOLUTION)
7️⃣ Add Jenkins to Docker Group
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins


🔑 MUST KNOW

Docker access is controlled via docker group

Never run Jenkins as root

8️⃣ Restart Services (MANDATORY)
sudo systemctl restart docker
sudo systemctl restart jenkins


⚠️ Restart is required for group changes to take effect

9️⃣ Re-Validate Docker Access

Run again:

sudo -u jenkins docker ps


Expected:

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE   COMMAND   STATUS


✔ This confirms Jenkins can run Docker commands

🔥 Interview Question (VERY COMMON)

Q: Jenkins is failing at docker build. What do you check?

Your Answer:

“I check whether the Jenkins user is part of the docker group and verify Docker daemon access using sudo -u jenkins docker ps.”

🔥 Strong, practical answer.

10️⃣ Validate Jenkins Can Run Shell Commands

In Jenkins UI:

Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Script Console


Run:

println "Jenkins is ready"


✔ Output shown → Jenkins functioning properly

11️⃣ FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST ✅
Check	Status
Jenkins service running	✅
Jenkins UI accessible	✅
Docker installed	✅
Docker service running	✅
Jenkins Docker access	✅
